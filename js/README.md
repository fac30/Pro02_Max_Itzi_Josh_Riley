# API Authentications

The `config.js` file should handle the loading and management of your environment variables and configuration settings. This allows you to centralize your configuration logic and makes it easier to access these settings throughout your project. It ensures sensitive information, like API keys, is not hard-coded into your application.

Here's a suggested structure for the `config.js` file:

### Explanation of `config.js`

1. **Loading Environment Variables with `dotenv`**: The file begins by requiring `dotenv/config`, which loads environment variables from your `.env` file into `process.env`. This is necessary to access sensitive configuration settings like your Discord bot token and OpenAI API key.

2. **Validating Environment Variables**:
   - It then checks whether all required environment variables (like `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are present.
   - If any required variables are missing, an error message is logged, and the application exits with an error code to prevent the bot from running without necessary configurations.

3. **Exporting Configuration Settings**:
   - The module exports an object containing the relevant configuration settings, making it easy to access them elsewhere in your project.
   - Optional settings like the bot prefix (`BOT_PREFIX`) and the OpenAI model (`OPENAI_MODEL`) are also included, with default values provided if they are not set in the environment.

### Using `config.js` in Your Bot

To use these settings in your bot's code, simply require the `config.js` file:

```javascript
const config = require('./config');

// Access configuration settings
const discordToken = config.discordToken;
const openaiApiKey = config.openaiApiKey;
const botPrefix = config.botPrefix;

// Example usage
client.login(discordToken);
```

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Centralized Configuration**: All configuration settings are in one place, making them easy to manage.
- **Security**: Sensitive information is never hard-coded into the source files, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily change or add new settings in `config.js` without having to modify multiple files.

By using this `config.js` file, you ensure that your bot is securely and efficiently configured, making it easy to maintain and extend in the future.
